	<content><blockquote>
<p>Systems of thought which approached the problems of nature in the 17th century where predominantly formed through metaphysical analysis by its <em>Geniuses</em>. Physics and its laws dominated the epoch&rsquo;s scientific philosophy, putting aside other perceptions of science which contrasted with its materialistic expression, such as biological notions that were <em>&lsquo;more subtle and divine than sense.'</em>[@Whitehead_1925,43] A divination of knowledge illustrates an emergent line of thought where the modern world sought naturalistic arts, and observational habits, to be more akin to fundamental truths than the deductive rationalism of end of century scholastics <em>(such as Newton, Galileo, Descartes, Boyle, Pascal ..)</em>. While Dynamical Astronomy, Engineering, and Physics adhered to the simple quantitative laws to construct a material universe sought by relations of measurable elements, modern Physiology and Psychology induced occurences as a &lsquo;set of happenings&rsquo; determining relations of the divine future and the known past.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For <em>Whitehead</em>, the mechanistic theory of nature firstly formularized by Newtons first law of motion, deals with the world as dynamically isolated systems where the minuest details of particular occurences are calculated. However, what he calls a <em>&lsquo;Fallacy of Misplaced Concretenss&rsquo;</em> is that The 17ths century <em>characteristic scientific philosphy</em> of juggling abstractions has paradoxically been accepted as the most concrete rendering of fact till today.</p>
